## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### What is Server Actions?
Create functions that run on the server. Next. js Actions allow us to create one-off functions alongside components that run on the server. They can often be a simpler alternative to API routes for data mutations.

whether you like the look of server actions or not in nextjs 13. the chances are the majority of the smaller forms (in the future) are going to be implemented using
server actions.
